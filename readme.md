# Learn Deno

> Learn Deno with my free video course at [Deno Beginner][d].

A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.

> Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.

- Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.
- Supports TypeScript out of the box.
- Ships only a single executable file.
- Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code formatter (deno fmt).
- Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work with Deno: deno.land/std

## Deno For Beginners Course

[Learn deno][d] by example. In this free crash course, [Awais](https://twitter.com/MrAhmadAwais/) will teach you what is Deno, how is Deno different than Node.js, and together you'll build three simple projects with deno. Not sure why I wrote that in 3rd person. ðŸ˜†
